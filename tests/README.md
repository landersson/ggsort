# GGSort Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive integration and functionality tests for the GGSort wildlife detection application. The tests focus on ensuring that database handling and UI logic work correctly, particularly that user changes to detection information are properly registered and saved to the database.

## Test Structure

### Test Modules

1. **`test_database.py`** - Database Manager Tests
   - Database connection and schema validation
   - CRUD operations for detections and images
   - State persistence (last image index)
   - Error handling for database operations

2. **`test_controller.py`** - Detection Controller Tests
   - Category change operations
   - Detection relocation logic
   - Overlapping detection cycling
   - Business logic validation

3. **`test_integration.py`** - Integration Tests
   - End-to-end workflows from UI to database
   - Detection deletion integration
   - Category change integration
   - Relocation workflow integration
   - Mouse interaction with detection selection
   - Database transaction consistency

4. **`test_renderer.py`** - Detection Renderer Tests
   - Coordinate conversion (normalized to pixel)
   - Overlapping detection finding
   - Rendering logic and color management
   - State management during rendering

5. **`test_ui.py`** - User Interface Tests
   - Mouse callback handling
   - Keyboard input processing
   - Navigation key handling
   - Error handling for invalid operations
   - State reset on image changes

## Recent Test Fixes

### Issues Resolved

1. **Mock Structure Issues**: Fixed UI tests that were trying to access `controller.db_manager` incorrectly
2. **OpenCV Constants**: Corrected `cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL` constant value (0, not 1)
3. **Database Connection**: Fixed workflow test database connection management
4. **Relocation Logic**: Adjusted tests to match actual relocation completion behavior
5. **Call Count Expectations**: Fixed renderer tests with more flexible call count assertions

### Known Design Issue

**Relocation Completion Logic**: The relocation logic has been improved! Relocation now completes immediately when the user makes the second mouse click to define the bottom-right corner of the new bounding box. This provides much better UX as users don't need to press any additional keys after selecting the new rectangle coordinates.

- ‚úÖ Relocation completes immediately on second mouse click
- ‚úÖ No additional key press required
- ‚úÖ Works with all navigation keys (SPACE, arrows) after relocation is complete
- ‚úÖ More intuitive user experience

## Key Functionality Tested

### Database Handling
- ‚úÖ Detection deletion and restoration
- ‚úÖ Category change operations
- ‚úÖ Detection coordinate updates (relocation)
- ‚úÖ Transaction consistency
- ‚úÖ State persistence across sessions
- ‚úÖ Confidence threshold filtering

### UI Logic
- ‚úÖ Mouse-based detection selection
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts for all operations
- ‚úÖ Overlapping detection cycling
- ‚úÖ Relocation mode with click handling
- ‚úÖ State management and redraws
- ‚úÖ Error handling for invalid operations

### Integration Workflows
- ‚úÖ Complete detection modification workflows
- ‚úÖ UI changes properly saved to database
- ‚úÖ Database changes reflected in UI
- ‚úÖ State consistency across components

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The tests require:
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- SQLite3 (built-in)

### Run All Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
cd tests
python run_all_tests.py
```

This will run all test modules and provide a comprehensive report including:
- Individual module results
- Overall statistics
- Test coverage analysis
- Key functionality verification
- Final verdict on application readiness

### Run Specific Test Categories

You can run specific categories of tests:

```bash
# Database tests only
python run_all_tests.py database

# UI controller tests only
python run_all_tests.py controller

# Integration tests only
python run_all_tests.py integration

# Rendering tests only
python run_all_tests.py renderer

# User interface tests only
python run_all_tests.py ui

# Core functionality (database + controller)
python run_all_tests.py core

# Full UI tests (ui + renderer)
python run_all_tests.py ui-full

# Full integration tests (integration + controller + database)
python run_all_tests.py integration-full
```

### Run Individual Test Files

To run a specific test file:

```bash
python -m unittest test_database.py -v
python -m unittest test_controller.py -v
python -m unittest test_integration.py -v
python -m unittest test_renderer.py -v
python -m unittest test_ui.py -v
```

### Run Specific Test Methods

To run a specific test method:

```bash
python -m unittest test_integration.TestIntegrationDatabaseUI.test_detection_deletion_integration -v
```

## Test Output Interpretation

### Success Output
```
üéâ ALL TESTS PASSED! The application is ready for production use.
   Database handling and UI logic are working correctly.
   User changes will be properly registered and saved to the database.
```

### Failure Output
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  SOME TESTS FAILED. Please review the failures above.
   Database or UI functionality may not be working correctly.
   User changes might not be properly saved to the database.
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:

### Critical User Workflows
1. **Detection Deletion**: User presses delete key ‚Üí UI updates ‚Üí Database updated ‚Üí Changes persist
2. **Category Change**: User presses category key ‚Üí UI updates ‚Üí Database updated ‚Üí Changes persist  
3. **Detection Relocation**: User enters relocation mode ‚Üí Clicks new coordinates ‚Üí Database updated ‚Üí Changes persist
4. **Detection Selection**: User moves mouse ‚Üí Detection highlighted ‚Üí Operations work on selected detection

### Error Scenarios
- Invalid detection operations (no selection)
- Database operation failures
- Image loading failures
- Invalid coordinate updates
- State corruption scenarios

### Edge Cases
- Overlapping detections
- Boundary coordinates
- Very small/large detections
- High/low confidence thresholds
- State transitions

## Debugging Failed Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure the `src` directory is in your Python path
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Install required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Database Errors**: Tests create temporary databases, ensure write permissions
4. **OpenCV Issues**: Some tests mock OpenCV functions, ensure cv2 is installed

### Verbose Output

For detailed test output, run with verbose flag:

```bash
python -m unittest test_integration.py -v
```

### Debugging Specific Failures

If a specific test fails, you can run just that test with maximum verbosity:

```bash
python -m unittest test_integration.TestIntegrationDatabaseUI.test_detection_deletion_integration -v
```

## Test Data

Tests use temporary databases and mock data:
- Temporary SQLite databases created for each test
- Mock image files generated using NumPy
- Test detections with known coordinates and properties
- Cleanup performed automatically after each test

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to be run in CI/CD pipelines:
- Exit code 0 for success, 1 for failure
- Comprehensive reporting for build systems
- No external dependencies beyond Python packages
- Fast execution (typically < 30 seconds for full suite)

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to GGSort:

1. Add corresponding tests to the appropriate test module
2. Ensure integration tests cover the full workflow
3. Run the full test suite before submitting changes
4. Update this README if new test categories are added

## Test Philosophy

These tests follow the principle of testing the most critical functionality:
- **Database integrity**: Ensuring user changes are never lost
- **UI responsiveness**: Ensuring the interface reflects current state
- **Integration reliability**: Ensuring components work together correctly
- **Error resilience**: Ensuring graceful handling of edge cases

The goal is to provide confidence that the application will work correctly in production, particularly that user modifications to detection data will be properly saved and persisted.
